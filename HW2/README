All five parts done.

New BNF Rules:

for ::= '{' [assignment] '$' [factor condition factor] '$' [assignment] '$' block '}'
condition ::= ['=''='] | ['<'['=']] | ['>'['=']] | ['!''=']

If factor condition factor is blank then it is an infinite loop

Also, the statement should be updated to

statement ::= assignment | print | do | if | for


Reasons for choosing for loop:
Since the most frequent iteration method we use in c programming is the for loop, and there are existing token (<,>,=,!) defined in this program, so it would be easy to overload these token for the for loop condition checking.
